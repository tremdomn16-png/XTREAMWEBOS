/**
 * CORS for the API surface.
 *
 * The TV client is packaged and runs from a foreign origin — `file://` on webOS, which
 * the browser sends as the literal string `null` — so every API response has to echo the
 * request Origin back, and preflights have to be answered.
 *
 * No `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`: the TV never authenticates with cookies (they do
 * not survive a `file://` origin), it uses a device Bearer token. Leaving credentials off
 * keeps the wildcard-ish echo from turning into a cross-site request forgery vector — a
 * hostile page can call the API without a token, and gets a 401 like anyone else.
 *
 * Deliberately free of Node-only imports (and of `server-only`): `middleware.ts` runs on
 * the Edge runtime and consumes these helpers.
