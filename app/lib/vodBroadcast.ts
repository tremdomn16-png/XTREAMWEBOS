/**
 * Turns a VOD (mp4/mkv file) into a "live" HLS broadcast via ffmpeg.
 *
 * A single ffmpeg process reads the provider file (ONE upstream connection) in
 * real time (`-re`) and segments it into a sliding HLS window. Multiple viewers
 * consume those segments through the relay, joining at the live edge — just like a
 * channel. So N people watching the same movie = ~1 connection on the provider.
 *
 * Liveness is driven by PLAYBACK, not by downloads. Fetching a segment proves
 * nothing: on a DEMUXER_ERROR the browser keeps pulling segments with 200 OK while
 * the <video> is dead, which used to keep ffmpeg (and the upstream connection) alive
 * forever. Only the client knows whether frames advanced, so each device reports it
 * through `reportConsumer` and the broadcast lives while someone is really watching.
 *
 * Guards against directory races:
 *  - Each run uses a UNIQUE directory (includes PID + timestamp + counter).
 *  - We NEVER delete the shared root folder (another process/instance — e.g.
 *    `next dev` recompiling — could be broadcasting inside it).
 *  - Cleanup only removes STALE directories (old mtime), never an active one.
